# GeometrySerialization
Exercise for my university. Semester 2.

<section>
Description:
<ul>
  <li>Create a class GeometricFigure, and classes handling specific figures (rectangle, triangle, circle). The methods of these classes should allow for initializing the parameters of each figure, and should also allow calculating the surface area and perimeter.</li>
  <li>Based on the created components, design an application that has the following functions:
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the user to choose one of the supported figures</li>
      <li>Add the figure object to a list</li>
      <li>Serialize and deserialize the figure pool objects to/from a file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
